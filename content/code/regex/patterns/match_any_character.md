## Preliminaries


```python
# Load regex package
import re
```

## Create some text


```python
# Create a variable containing a text string
text = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown bear.'
```

## Apply regex


```python
# Find anything with a 'T' and then the next two characters
re.findall(r'T..', text)
```




    ['The']
