## Create Bucket

Make a bucket (`mb`) on AWS S3 called `kicks-pasta-steer`. The bucket name you choose must be _globally_ unique, meaning nobody else in the world must have used that bucket name before.

{{< highlight markdown >}}
aws s3 mb s3://kicks-pasta-steer
{{< /highlight >}}

```
make_bucket: kicks-pasta-steer
```
