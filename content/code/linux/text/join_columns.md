The Linux command `join` operates similar to the join command in SQL, merging two sets of data along a common key.

## Make File With Soldier Names And Soldier Age Data

echo "Bob Dosjki, 22" >> soldiers.txt
echo "Jack Doi, 45" >> soldiers.txt
echo "Poe Domi, 23" >> soldiers.txt

## Join Soldier And Regiment Data

In the below code we `join` the two comma delimited (`-t ,`) files using the first column of file 1 (`-1 1`) and the first column of file 2 (`-2 1`) as merge keys. File 1 and file 2 are `soldiers.txt` and `regiments.txt` respectively.

{{< highlight markdown >}}
join -t , -1 1 -2 1 soldiers.txt regiments.txt
{{< /highlight >}}
```
Steve Case, 23, The Hell Hosts
Mary Mills, 35, The Hell Hosts
Bob Dosjki, 22, The Red Riders
Jack Doi, 45, The Red Riders
Poe Domi, 23, The Forsaken Battalion
