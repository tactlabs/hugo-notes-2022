## List Processes

We are often interested in the `STAT` column:
- `R` - process is running
- `S` - process is sleeping
- `D` - process is in uninterruptible sleep
- `T` - process is terminated
- `D` - process is dead
- `<` - process is high priority
- `N` - process is low priority

Note that normally the list of processes is very long, so for the sake of this tutorial we included `| head` which will show only the first few processes.
