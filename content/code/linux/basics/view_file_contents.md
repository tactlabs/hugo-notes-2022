Often we want to look at the contents of some code or configuration file. In Linux, we can do this using the `less` command.

## Create A Text File With Some Contents

{{< highlight markdown >}}
echo "Hello World" > hello_world.txt
{{< /highlight >}}

## View Contents Of File

To view the contents of a file we can open it in the `nano`, a common text editor in Linux systems.

{{< highlight markdown >}}
nano hello_world.txt
{{< /highlight >}}

If we want to leave a file we can press `ctrl-x`.
