K-nearest neighbors classifier (KNN) is a simple and powerful classification learner. 

KNN has three basic parts:

- $y\_i$: The class of an observation (what we are trying to predict in the test data).
- $X\_i$: The predictors/IVs/attributes of an observation.
- $K$: A positive number specified by the researcher. K denotes the number of observations closest to a particular observation that define its "neighborhood". For example, K=2 means that each observation's has a neighorhood comprising of the two other observations closest to it.

Imagine we have an observation where we know its independent variables $x\_{test}$ but do not know its class $y\_{test}$. The KNN learner finds the K other observations that are closest to $x\_{test}$ and uses their known classes to assign a classes to $\_{test}$.

## Preliminaries


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import neighbors
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline  
import seaborn
```

## Create Dataset

Here we create three variables, `test_1` and `test_2` are our independent variables, 'outcome' is our dependent variable. We will use this data to train our learner.


```python
training_data = pd.DataFrame()

training_data['test_1'] = [0.3051,0.4949,0.6974,0.3769,0.2231,0.341,0.4436,0.5897,0.6308,0.5]
training_data['test_2'] = [0.5846,0.2654,0.2615,0.4538,0.4615,0.8308,0.4962,0.3269,0.5346,0.6731]
training_data['outcome'] = ['win','win','win','win','win','loss','loss','loss','loss','loss']

training_data.head()
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>test_1</th>
      <th>test_2</th>
      <th>outcome</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0.3051</td>
      <td>0.5846</td>
      <td>win</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>0.4949</td>
      <td>0.2654</td>
      <td>win</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>0.6974</td>
      <td>0.2615</td>
      <td>win</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>0.3769</td>
      <td>0.4538</td>
      <td>win</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>0.2231</td>
      <td>0.4615</td>
      <td>win</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## Plot the data

This is not necessary, but because we only have three variables, we can plot the training dataset. The X and Y axes are the independent variables, while the colors of the points are their classes.


```python
seaborn.lmplot('test_1', 'test_2', data=training_data, fit_reg=False,hue="outcome", scatter_kws={"marker": "D","s": 100})
```

## Convert Data Into np.arrays

The `scikit-learn` library requires the data be formatted as a `numpy` array. Here are doing that reformatting.


```python
X = training_data.as_matrix(columns=['test_1', 'test_2'])
y = np.array(training_data['outcome'])
```

## Train The Learner

This is our big moment. We train a KNN learner using the parameters that an observation's neighborhood is its three closest neighors. `weights = 'uniform'` can be thought of as the voting system used. For example, `uniform` means that all neighbors get an equally weighted "vote" about an observation's class while `weights = 'distance'` would tell the learner to weigh each observation's "vote" by its distance from the observation we are classifying. 


```python
clf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(3, weights = 'uniform')
trained_model = clf.fit(X, y)
```

## View The Model's Score 

How good is our trained model compared to our training data?


```python
trained_model.score(X, y)
```




    0.80000000000000004



Our model is 80% accurate! 

_Note: that in any real world example we'd want to compare the trained model to some holdout test data. But since this is a toy example I used the training data_.

## Apply The Learner To A New Data Point

Now that we have trained our model, we can predict the class any new observation, $y_{test}$. Let us do that now!


```python
# Create a new observation with the value of the first independent variable, 'test_1', as .4 
# and the second independent variable, test_1', as .6 
x_test = np.array([[.4,.6]])
```


```python
# Apply the learner to the new, unclassified observation.
trained_model.predict(x_test)
```




    array(['loss'], dtype=object)



Huzzah! We can see that the learner has predicted that the new observation's class is `loss`.

We can even look at the probabilities the learner assigned to each class:


```python
trained_model.predict_proba(x_test)
```




    array([[ 0.66666667,  0.33333333]])



According to this result, the model predicted that the observation was `loss` with a ~67% probability and `win` with a ~33% probability. Because the observation had a greater probability of being `loss`, it predicted that class for the observation.

## Notes

- The choice of K has major affects on the classifer created.
- The greater the K, more linear (high bias and low variance) the decision boundary.
- There are a variety of ways to measure distance, two popular being simple euclidean distance and cosine similarity.
