In scikit-learn, LDA is implemented using `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` includes a parameter, `n_components` indicating the number of features we want returned. To figure out what argument value to use with `n_components` (e.g. how many parameters to keep), we can take advantage of the fact that `explained_variance_ratio_` tells us the variance explained by each outputted feature and is a sorted array. 

Specifically, we can run `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` with `n_components` set to `None` to return ratio of variance explained by every component feature, then calculate how many components are required to get above some threshold of variance explained (often 0.95 or 0.99).

## Preliminaries


```python
# Load libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
```

## Load Iris Data


```python
# Load the Iris flower dataset:
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
```

## Run Linear Discriminant Analysis


```python
# Create and run an LDA
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=None)
X_lda = lda.fit(X, y)
```

## Create List Of Explained Variances


```python
# Create array of explained variance ratios
lda_var_ratios = lda.explained_variance_ratio_
```

## Create Function Calculating Number Of Components Required To Pass Threshold


```python
# Create a function
def select_n_components(var_ratio, goal_var: float) -> int:
    # Set initial variance explained so far
    total_variance = 0.0
    
    # Set initial number of features
    n_components = 0
    
    # For the explained variance of each feature:
    for explained_variance in var_ratio:
        
        # Add the explained variance to the total
        total_variance += explained_variance
        
        # Add one to the number of components
        n_components += 1
        
        # If we reach our goal level of explained variance
        if total_variance >= goal_var:
            # End the loop
            break
            
    # Return the number of components
    return n_components
```

## Run Function


```python
# Run function
select_n_components(lda_var_ratios, 0.95)
```
