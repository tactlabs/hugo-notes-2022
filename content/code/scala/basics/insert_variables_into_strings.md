The proper term from this is _string interpolation_.

## Create A Value


```scala
// Create some values
val number_of_soldiers: Short = 542
val casualties: Short = 32
```

## Add The Value To A String


```scala
print(f"Before the battle we had $number_of_soldiers soldiers. However, now we have ${number_of_soldiers - casualties}.")
```

    Before the battle we had 542 soldiers. However, now we have 510.
