### Create some simulated variables


```python
x = 6
```


```python
y = 9
```


```python
z = 12
```

### x or y


```python
x or y
```




    6



### x and y


```python
x and y
```




    9



### not x


```python
not x
```




    False



### x is equal to y


```python
x == y
```




    False



### x is not equal to y


```python
x != y
```




    True



### One is less than two


```python
1 < 2
```




    True



### Two is less than or equal to four


```python
2 <= 4
```




    True



### Three is equal to five


```python
3 == 5
```




    False



### Three is not equal to four


```python
3 != 4
```




    True



### x is less than y which is less than z


```python
x < y < z
```




    True



### x is less than y and y is less than z


```python
x < y and y < z
```




    True
